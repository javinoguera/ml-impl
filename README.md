Basic ML algorithm implementations

Some very rudimentary implementations of machine learning algorithms in Scala including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and a Basic Multi Layer Perceptor.
It includes some custom linear algebra classes, functions and data loading functions.

There is also a wrapper of L-BFGS minimizer from [lbfgs4j](https://github.com/vinhkhuc/lbfgs4j)  

Test data was taken from Andrew NG's Machine Learning course from Coursera
